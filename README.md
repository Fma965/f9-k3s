# F9-K3S
Kubernetes GitOps using [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/)

`git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/`

Check my [Wiki](https://wiki.f9.casa) for more details! (WIP)

All `secret.enc.yaml` and `*-secret.enc.yaml` files are encrypted with SOPS using AGE.

I have included `secret.sample.yaml` and `*-secret.sample.yaml` files which contain placeholder values to enhance the usability.
